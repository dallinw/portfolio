    BIO: [
        "Mikaella Antonio was born in Makati, Philippines in 1997 and immigrated with her family to South Carolina in 2003. In her drawings, Antonio combines textual and visual elements to examine relationships between narrative forms and lived experience. Her work investigates how we tell stories about ourselves, how we choose to exist among others, and how we navigate between inner and public life. Her characters play out various fictions, embracing their emotions, celebrating their communities and never assuming just one, exact way of being.",
        "Antonio received B.A.’s in English and Art Studio at the University of South Carolina. She currently lives in Charlotte, NC, where she works for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library."

    STATEMENT: [
        "I have kept a diary since the age of 7. What began as documentation of life events has evolved, in my current practice of drawing in journals, into examinations of the relationships between narrative forms and lived experience, memory and time, and inner and public life. The journal, traditionally a private space for honing ideas, is now presented as finished enough to engage with, and as a down to earth art object that invites itself to be handled. (My free, printable puzzles, search & finds, and coloring pages are similarly intended to decrease barriers to interacting with art.) Beyond journals, my work is nevertheless influenced by notions of finish, privacy, and intimacy.",
        "My characters represent multifaceted and alternative selves, as well as members of a community. They gesture, dance, emote and generally take up space, acting in everyday scenes and playing out various fictions. They just as readily wreak havoc as they nurture each other, never finding themselves locked in any singular identity. On the page, they have free rein to be playful explorers, mischievous troublemakers, dramatic fashionistas, disciplined artists, sensual women, mournful ladies, and always hopeful, expressive communicators. Their figures, simplified to contours and dynamic shapes, are enlarged, diminished, entangled and multiplied-- embodying not only themselves, but their collective identities.",
        "I studied English in college and I am a bilingual Tagalog-English speaker. As we all must, I navigate worlds of language. Recognizing variations in speech and text as I travel, meet new people, and read, noting differences between how language is employed among strangers versus family, and knowing that the language of my inner world doesn’t perfectly mirror standard English-- this is evidence that we all do the work of making language, every day. We must never forget that English, a language of power and therefore a tool of subjugation, is only one, albeit widely-prescribed, way of expressing ourselves. It is not, and has never been, superior to other languages, dialects or ways of being, and it will never fully govern the way our thoughts form.",
        "By incorporating text into my drawings, using as many methods of communication as I know, I bend rules of literary and visual art. I make a space on paper that evokes the exhilarating experience of inhabiting and navigating the world, where inanimate objects and icons evoke great feeling and snippets of dialogue provide a context for the theatrical gestures of characters-- and where everything has a right to be."
